Spectrotune is a Processing application (http://www.processing.org) which scans a
polyphonic audio source like a wav or mp3 file, performs pitch detection and
outputs to MIDI.

Spectrotune offers adjustable options to help improve pitch detection, including:

  * Pitch Class Profiling (PCP) 
  * FFT bin distance Weighting
  * FFT Envelopes
  * FFT Equalization
  * Adjustable noise smoothing
  * Adjustable peak threshold 
  * Octave toggles

Install:

  * Install processing (http://www.processing.org)
  
  * Install rwmidi (http://ruinwesen.com/support-files/rwmidi-0.1c.zip) 

  * Clone Spectrotune and place inside your Processing Sketchbook directory
  
    cd ~/Documents/Processing (this is where I keep mine)
    git clone git://github.com/corbanbrook/spectrotune.gi
    
  * Make sure your operating systems MIDI interface is configured properly.

Usage:

  * Open Midi enabled sequencer software, ie Reason, Cubase, Fruityloops, etc.

  * Open processing
  
  * Edit the line of spectrotune.pde that specifies the audioFile you wish to open

  * Run

  If you are using a midi enabled sequencer software you should be able to record
  the input and pass on to any soft synth, or hardware synth.
